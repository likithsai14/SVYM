# TODO: Enhance Responsiveness for Desktop and Mobile Compatibility

## Tasks
- [ ] Update svymfrontend/css/style.css to add media queries for layout responsiveness (stack sections vertically on mobile)
- [ ] Review and enhance media queries in other CSS files for consistency (use 768px as tablet breakpoint, 480px for mobile)
- [ ] Ensure tables and grids are responsive across all pages
- [ ] Test responsiveness on various screen sizes (simulate via browser dev tools)
- [ ] Verify all HTML files have proper viewport meta tag (already confirmed for some)

## Notes
- The application is web-based and already partially responsive.
- Focus on improving layout stacking and element sizing for mobile devices.
- Use consistent breakpoints: 480px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop).
