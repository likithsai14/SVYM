# TODO: Make Admin Organization Page Dynamic

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update `svymfrontend/admin_organization.html`: Add modals for editing mission, vision, values (add/edit/delete), FAQs (add/edit/delete), and contact details (emails, phones, addresses, social media).
- [x] Update `svymfrontend/Javascripts/admin_organization.js`: Fetch and populate aboutus, help, contact data on page load.
- [x] Update `svymfrontend/Javascripts/admin_organization.js`: Add event listeners to view/edit/add/delete buttons.
- [x] Update `svymfrontend/Javascripts/admin_organization.js`: Handle modals - pre-populate forms for edit, empty for add, confirm for delete.
- [x] Update `svymfrontend/Javascripts/admin_organization.js`: Call appropriate APIs for save/delete and refresh data after operations.
- [x] Ensure modals integrate with existing `modal.js` and `modal.css`.
- [x] Leave team section static as no backend exists.
- [x] Add modal CSS styles to `admin_organization.css`.
